## Installing (regular python addon) :

* Save the raw [*Backface Hiding v0-1.py*](https://github.com/ChameleonScales/Backface-Hiding/raw/master/Backface%20Hiding%20v0-1.py) file anywhere on your computer
* In Blender, open the User Preferences and go in the “Addons” tab
* Click on “Install from file” at the bottom
* Find the addon you downloaded
* Enable it by checking the box in the Addons list
* Now you should find the buttons in the Properties region of any 3DView in Edit mode, under Mesh Display.

## All current features :

* **Hide backfacing :** hides the backfacing geometry (can be revealed with Alt+H)
* **Hide non-visible :** hides the geometry that's occluded by the view, including the screen area outside of the 3DView editor.

## TODO list :

* Make it work on rotated objects
